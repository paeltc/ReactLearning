Context
 Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree 
 without having to pass props down manually at every level.

There are 3 steps to implement when making use of context
 1- create the context
 2- Provide a context value
 3- Consume the context value

Can also be done using context type property of a class.
 1- Export the userContext itself
 2- Assign the userContext to the context type property of the class
 3- using ComponentE1.contextType or static contextType

ComponentE1.contextType 
 Can be use to consumme multiple context.

 Only work with class component. 
 You can only subcribe to a single context using context type
