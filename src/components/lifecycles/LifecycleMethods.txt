Lifecycle Methods

1- Mounting Lifecycle Methods
  constructor(props)
   * A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created
   * Initializing state
   * Binding the event handlers
   * Do not cause side effects, Ex: HTTP requests
   * super(props)
   * Directly overwrite this.state

  getDerivedStateFromProps(props,state)
   * When the state of the component depends on changes in props over time
   * Set the state
   * Do not cause side effects, Ex: HTTP requests

  render()
   * Only required Method
   * Read props & state and return JSX
   * Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls
   * Children component lifecycle method are also executed

  componentDidMount()
   * Invoked immediately after a component and all children components have been rendered to the DOM
   * Cause side effects. Ex: interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data

2- Updating Lifecycle Methods
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
   * Method is called every time a component is re-rendered
   * Set the state
   * Do not cause side effect. Ex: HTTP requests

  shouldComponentUpdate()
   * Dictaes if the component should re-render or not 
   * Performance optimization
   * Do not cause side effects. Ex: HTTP requests, Calling the setState method

  render()
   * Only required method
   * Read props & state and return JSX
   * Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.

  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
   * Called right before the changes from the virtual DOM. Are to be reflected in the DOM
   * Capture aome information from the DOM
   * Method will either return null or return a value. Return value will be passed as the third parameter to the next method

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
   * Called after the render is finished in the re-render cycles
   * Cause side effects

3- Unmounting Lifecycle Methods
  componentWillUnmount()
   * Method is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed
   * Cancelling any network requests, removing event handler, cancelling any sbscriptions and also invalidating times
   * Do not call the setState method

4- Error Handling Phase Methods
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
   * Call when there is error either during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any shild component
  componentDidCatch(error, info)
  * Call when there is error either during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any shild component
