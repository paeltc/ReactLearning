Error Handling Phase Methods

Error Boundary
A class component that implements either one or both of the lifecycle Methods
getDerivedStateFromError or componentDidCatch becomes an error Boundary

The static method getDerivedStateFromError method is used to render a fallback
UI after an error is thrown and the componentDidCatch method is used to log
the error information

static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
componentDidCatch(error, info)

Summary
Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript error in their child
component tree, log those errors, and display a fall-back UI

A class component becomes an Error Boundary by defining either or both of
getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycle methods.

The placement of the Error Boundary also matters as it controls if the entire app 
should have the fall-back UI or just the component causing the problem.
